The following repository contains the relevant code from my thesis on the subject of "Virtual Reality Interface for Controlling Remote Vehicles while Handling Communication Latency."

The repository is divided into the following projects:
- CarDNN: This Python project is responsible for training the DNN model used for predicting vehicle dynamics.
- CarSimClient: A Python project that facilitates the connection between the vehicle simulation and the user interface.
- RC_UI: This Unity project contains the user interface for controlling the remote vehicle in the simulation.
- VR_CarSim: A Unity project that simulates the physics of the vehicle based on AirSim.
- jetson_on_wheels: A ROS environment responsible for controlling the scaled-down vehicle with a Jetson Nano.
- VR_remote_control_car_client: A Unity project that includes the user interface for controlling the scaled-down vehicle.
